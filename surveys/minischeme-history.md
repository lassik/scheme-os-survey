# Mini-Scheme history

Mini-Scheme (which goes by the filenames `minischeme` and `miniscm`)
is at once one of the tiniest and earliest Scheme implementations. Its
obscure beginnings and the several independent forks started in the
decades since have led to a confusing family tree which this page
tries to untangle.

## Original versions from Japan

The original author of Mini-Scheme is mathematician Atsushi Moriwaki
from Kyoto University. After he stopped working on the program, his
compatriot Akira Kida maintained it for five years.

Information about these early versions is found in the `README` file
of version 0.85k4. The file says the program is based on an article
_SCHEME Interpreter in Common Lisp_ which was published in Japan as an
appendix of T. Matsuda & K. Saigo, _Programming of LISP_, archive No 5
(1987) p6 - p42.

[SourceForge project `minischeme`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minischeme/)

### Cat's Eye Technologies

[GitHub repository `catseye/minischeme`](https://github.com/catseye/minischeme)

## TinyScheme

The well-known implementation TinyScheme started off as a Mini-Scheme
fork but has been refactored and extended so much that the name was
changed.

## Archival

Releases of the various Mini-Scheme forks are archived at
[files.scheme.org](https://files.scheme.org/) using a file naming
convention which includes the maintainer's handle as well as a version
number or release date.
